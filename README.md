1. [BouncyCastle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle/)
2. [System.Data.SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite.Core/)

for sqlite, you need copy SQLite.Interop.dll into output folder.

anyone that don't want to download the depedencies, i have prepared it ready in [Library folder](/Library)

### Issue
**Update 2020**

There is a small problem with the master password input, sometimes when opening and closing the database it will make correctly entered master password considered wrong by the program, this is actually a bug and can be overcome by restarting the program.
